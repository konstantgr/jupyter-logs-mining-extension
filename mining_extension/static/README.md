Thank you for participating in the “Analysis of Execution Logs in Jupyter Notebooks” research
study. In this study, we plan to analyze the way data science experts implement their data
analytics workflows by looking at code execution logs. During this study, you will implement two
data analytics tasks in your Jupyter environment, and we will analyze the data collected by the
logging plugin you will need to install before starting to code. We will collect cell execution
events throughout the notebook, to be able to study the way the code and its execution evolves
over time. The data collected will be anonymous: we will collect “the id of the execution action,
the time when the action was executed, a session id, kernel id, the notebook name, the type of
action, the cell id, the cell execution number, the type of cell, the source code in the cell, and
the cell output”. The logging plugin was developed by JetBrains research, and it sends the
collected data to a secure server hosted by JetBrains.

With this data analysis, we aim to obtain findings that can contribute to the future development
of Jupyter tools with the goal of helping data scientists in their daily coding tasks. 
I understand the following:

- Even if I agree to participate now, I can withdraw from the study at any time. 
- The purpose and nature of the study was explained to me, and I have had the 
opportunity to ask questions about the study.
- I do not need to disclose personal information. 
- I am entitled to access the information I have provided at any time.
- The results of this research will be published in a scientific publication. Following best 
practices in science, we plan to publish the collected anonymous dataset, to facilitate the
reproducibility of our research. 
- Both UZH and Jetbrains researchers will analyze the anonymous data collected during 
this study.
- For each participant submitting a Jupyter notebook containing the complete solution to 
the give task, we will donate 10 CHF to a non-profit organization that you select from the 
following list: Wikimedia, University Hospital Zurich Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and 
The Apache Software Foundation
